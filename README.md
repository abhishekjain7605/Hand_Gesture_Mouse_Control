# üñêÔ∏è Hand Gesture Mouse Control

Control your computer mouse using hand gestures detected through your webcam! This project uses Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Flask to create a virtual mouse interface. The gestures are processed in real-time and translated into mouse actions like move, click, scroll, and drag.

## üöÄ Features

* Real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe
* Cursor movement with index finger
* Left-click, right-click, and drag gestures
* Scroll with hand movements
* Web-based interface using Flask
* MongoDB integration for logging or analytics
